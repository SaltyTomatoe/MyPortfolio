# Dustin Binalla
Programmer & Reverse Engineer hobbyist.
I also enjoy playing & creating games, Enineering and I'm learning 3d modelling.

## Programming
My greatest achievements so far include my personal obfuscator, and a program I had created which got around 1-5 active users and 100 total users.

### Definition
"Obfuscator": One that obfuscates; **"Obfuscate"**, to render obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.


A code obfuscator is a program that takes code and renders it uncomprehendable by human means, while still retaining it's functionality.
ig; transforms code into something that can still be run while protecting it from people trying to steal parts of it or how it functions.


More information on the **obfuscator** can be found [here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/obfuscator)

More information on my other **program** and the *authentication* sytem I had built up can be found [here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/authynwhatever)

I have self taught myself a variety of languages, but the languages I am most proficient in are [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [NodeJs/Javascript](https://nodejs.org/en/). I also have experience in Java, C#, and Python. I never really approached a language with the sole objective of wanting to learn it just to actually know it, there always was a practical reason behind it. For instance, I learned Lua when I expirimented with game design in popular gaming platform [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/home). Most of my Lua exposure came from roblox and I am to create a game with a playerbase of around 100 people eventually. My obfuscator targets Lua and is written in NodeJs.

I first started learning NodeJs primarily for **Discord Bot Development**. Discord is a chat platform in which you can develop bots to enhance your chatgroups, with almost limitless possibilities. You can create bots for the sole purpose of moderation, or with various uses including entertainment, moderation, and communication. I have since stopped developing discord bots but most of my *obfuscator* is written in NodeJs.
