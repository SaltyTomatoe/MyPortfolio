**About Me**
Programmer & Reverse Engineer hobbyist.
I also enjoy playing & creating games, Enineering and I'm learning 3d modelling.

## Programming
My greatest achievements so far include my personal obfuscator, and a program I had created which got around 1-5 active users and 100 total users.

### Definition
"Obfuscator": One that obfuscates; **"Obfuscate"**, to render obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.


A code obfuscator is a program that takes code and renders it uncomprehendable by human means, while still retaining it's functionality.
ig; transforms code into something that can still be run while protecting it from people trying to steal parts of it or how it functions.


More information on the **obfuscator** can be found [here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/obfuscator)

More information on my other **program** and the *authentication* sytem I had built up can be found [here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/authynwhatever)

I have self taught myself a variety of languages, but the languages I am most proficient in are [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [NodeJs/Javascript](https://nodejs.org/en/). I also have experience in Java, C#, and Python. I never really approached a language with the sole objective of wanting to learn it just to actually know it, there always was a practical reason behind it. For instance, I learned Lua when I expirimented with game design in popular gaming platform [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/home). Most of my Lua exposure came from roblox and I am to create a game with a playerbase of around 100 people eventually. My obfuscator targets Lua and is written in NodeJs.
To learn how to program in specific languages, I originally start off by watching tutorials on how to do a certain task. Once I have a good grasp of how something works, I go from there. The only programming language that wasn't self mostly if not all self taught would be Java becauase I am taking a Java course as a junior.
I first started learning NodeJs primarily for **Discord Bot Development**. Discord is a chat platform in which you can develop bots to enhance your chatgroups, with almost limitless possibilities. You can create bots for the sole purpose of moderation, or with various uses including entertainment, moderation, and communication. I have since stopped developing discord bots but most of my *obfuscator* is written in NodeJs.

All files with the **".js"** extension are NodeJs files. 
I have minimal experience in python, as I had used it for backend web development. This has been used to authenticate users and ensure only authorized users have the ability to use another program/service I had (past-tense as the service has been discontinued).

[here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/obfuscator) I go more in depth on the process of how my obfuscator functions, and how I built it to where it is as well as how I reverse engineered & anaylzed multiple different Virtual machines for inspiration and ideas.

[here](https://saltytomatoe.github.io/MyPortfolio/authynwhatever) I explain the authentication process for the backend of my site, and how it was used to generate a somewhat secure client to server authentication platform. 

Other projects such as discord bot development aren't up to the standards I now have for myself, as such they will not be discussed in any further detail.
For my history of game design, I have dedicated [this](https://coolmathgames.com) page to information about it. I cannot say that I have gotten a good platform of players, but I aim to have a fully functional multiplayer online arcade game by the end of January 2021. Work is already in motion.
