My greatest achievements so far include my personal obfuscator, and a program I had created which got around 1-5 active users and 100 total users.

### Definition
One that obfuscates; **"Obfuscate"**, to render obscure, unclear, or unintelligible.
A code obfuscator is a program that takes code and renders it uncomprehendable by human means, while still retaining it's functionality.
ig; transforms code into something that can still be run while protecting it from people trying to steal parts of it or how it functions.
